Autonomous Robot Control Language
=================================
Fast Flexible Exentensible Accessible
------------------------------------------
__ARC-Language__ or simply __ARC__ is a simplified control language
for Robotic programming.

This language was concieved to solve the
problem of the difficulty of programming for autonomous robotics.

## Purpose
__ARC__ is designed to make the task of programming autonomous robotics
tasks easier and more accessible. Code for programming autonomous
parts of a robot for competitions is often a tedious task involving
making minute changes to code, recompiling, and then reuploading
in a tormentously slow process.

## Features
The _ARC-LANG_ specification is designed to be __Fast, Flexible,
Extensible, and Accesible.__

### Fast
__ARC__ enables
the developer to program the robot more rapidly by allowing the robot's
functionality to be changed without recompiling the code. The .arc
files can be even edited by a custom interface on the robot if desired
or edited remotely.


### Flexible
__ARC__ can either be run via an interpreter or even assembled
into the robot's respective language to be hardcoded into the program
itself when fully developed for even higher performance. One could
even link it with assembly or pure machine code(if desired of course),

###Extensible
__ARC__ merely is a specification, it is designed to be expanded to suit
the programmers needs.
__Static Support:__ the language can be used to program a "robotic animation"
__Dynamic Support:__ the language can be used to program heuristics where a robot
can make decisions based of input with programmed logic.

### Accessible
__ARC__ is designed to abstract complex robotic process into syntax
that can be _easily learned by people who are not familiar with
programming (i.e. engineering team members)_
